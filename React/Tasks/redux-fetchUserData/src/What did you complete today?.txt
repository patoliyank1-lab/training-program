What do you plan for tomorrow?
 Middleware, DevTools & Performance

Any impediments in your way?
- multiple time rerendering of component due to state change, solved by using conditional rendering techniques.
- get Proxy-Array in response, solved by using JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() to convert it to array.
Did you successfully complete your planned task?
